# Cloroxwipes110's Custom Combat
This is the GitHub repository for one of my [Modrinth projects.](https://modrinth.com/datapack/cloroxwipes110s-custom-combat)

## What is this?

This is a data/resource pack for the indie game Minecraft, which modifies the game without having to install a mod launcher, such as Fabric.
As the name states, this data/resource pack focuses on combat, with new weapons added that you can get from the very start of a world.  
Check the Wiki for full contents, crafting recipies, and functionality of items.
