# Cloroxwipes110's Custom Combat
This is the GitHub repository for one of my [Modrinth projects.](https://modrinth.com/datapack/cloroxwipes110s-custom-combat)

## What is this?

This is a data/resource pack for the indie game Minecraft, which modifies the game without having to install a mod launcher, such as Fabric.
As the name states, this data/resource pack focuses on combat, with new weapons added that you can get from the very start of a world. Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Cloroxwipes110/Cloroxwipes110-s-Custom-Combat/wiki) for full contents, crafting recipies, and functionality of items.

## How to find files?

Go to the branch with the name the version you are looking to download, and the datapack/resource pack files will be there. Then, follow the directions on the Installation page of the wiki.  
**Versions are VERY specific. Do not install 1.21.3 on 1.21.4**.
